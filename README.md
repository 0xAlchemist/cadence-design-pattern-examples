# cadence-design-pattern-examples [WIP]

A simple demonstration of common [Cadence design patterns](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/design-patterns)

## Deployment

Install `flow-cli` using these instructions

Clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/0xAlchemist/cadence-design-pattern-examples`

Change into the cloned directory `cd cadence-design-pattern-examples`

Open this directory in a terminal window and run `flow emulator -v`

Open this directory in a separate terminal window and run `make`

The code will be deployed to the default emulator account and the transactions will
be processed using the Go tooling script in the `/demo` folder.

## What's next?
